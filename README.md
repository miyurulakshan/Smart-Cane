Features of the Smart Cane:
1.	Obstacle Detection and Avoidance:   DONE
•	Ultrasonic Sensors: Placed at various positions on the cane, these sensors detect obstacles at different heights (such as low-lying objects, waist-high barriers, and overhead obstructions). They alert the user with vibrations and auditory signals to help them navigate around obstacles.
2.	Navigation Assistance:
•	GPS Module: Integrated for real-time location tracking and navigation. It connects to a smartphone app that allows users to input destinations and receive turn-by-turn directions through haptic feedback and voice guidance.
•	Bluetooth Connectivity: Ensures seamless communication between the cane and the smartphone app, allowing for easy updates and user interaction.
3.	Fall Detection DONE and Emergency Assistance:
•	Accelerometer and Gyroscope: These sensors monitor the user's movements and detect falls. In case of a fall, the cane can automatically send an alert to predefined emergency contacts, including the user's location.
4.	Environmental Sensing DONE:
•	Ambient Light Sensor: Adjusts the brightness of any visual indicators on the cane, ensuring they are visible in various lighting conditions.
•	Temperature and Humidity Sensors: Provide real-time weather information to the user, helping them prepare for their day.
5.	Voice Commands and Feedback:
•	Microphone and Speaker: Allow the user to interact with the cane using voice commands. The speaker provides auditory feedback for navigation, obstacle detection, and other notifications.

Sensors and Components:
1.	Ultrasonic Sensors: For obstacle detection at different heights.
2.	GPS Module: For real-time location tracking and navigation assistance.
3.	Bluetooth Module: For connectivity with the smartphone app.
4.	Accelerometer and Gyroscope: For detecting falls and sudden movements.
5.	Ambient Light Sensor: For adjusting visual indicators based on lighting conditions.
6.	Temperature and Humidity Sensors: For providing weather updates.
7.	Microphone and Speaker: For voice command functionality and auditory feedback.
8.	Vibration Motors: Embedded in the handle to provide haptic feedback.







GPS navigation

Integrating Google Maps with a smart cane built using Arduino can be an innovative project to aid navigation for the visually impaired. Here's a step-by-step outline of how you might approach this:
Components Needed:
1.	Arduino Board (e.g., Arduino Uno or Nano)
2.	GPS Module (e.g., NEO-6M GPS module)
3.	Bluetooth Module (e.g., HC-05 or HC-06 for Android integration)
4.	Smartphone with Google Maps App
5.	Buzzer/Vibration Motor (for haptic feedback)
6.	Battery Pack (for powering the Arduino and modules)
Steps to Integrate Google Maps with a Smart Cane
1. Setting Up the GPS Module
•	Connect the GPS module to the Arduino. This typically involves connecting the VCC and GND to power and ground, respectively, and the TX and RX pins to the Arduino's RX and TX pins.
•	Use a GPS library (e.g., TinyGPS++) to read the GPS coordinates from the module.
2. Establishing Bluetooth Communication
•	Connect the Bluetooth module to the Arduino. Similarly, connect the VCC and GND to power and ground, and the TX and RX pins to the Arduino's RX and TX pins (or to SoftwareSerial pins if the hardware serial is used by the GPS module).
•	Write a simple serial communication protocol to send GPS coordinates from the Arduino to a smartphone.
3. Developing a Smartphone App
•	Create a basic Android app using Android Studio.
•	Use the Bluetooth API to establish communication with the Arduino.
•	Read the GPS coordinates sent from the Arduino via Bluetooth.
4. Integrating Google Maps in the App
•	Use the Google Maps API to display the user's location based on the received GPS coordinates.
•	Implement navigation features within the app, such as setting a destination and providing turn-by-turn directions.
5. Providing Feedback via the Cane
•	Based on the navigation data, send commands from the app to the Arduino via Bluetooth (e.g., turn left, turn right, go straight).
•	Use the Arduino to trigger a buzzer or vibration motor to provide haptic feedback to the user.
